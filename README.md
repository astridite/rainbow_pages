# The Rainbow Pages

The internet has been an enabling tool for LGBTQIA+ people to find community, shared interests and emotional support. We would like to continue in this tradition by creating a repository of out-and-proud LQBTQIA+ people, organisations and businesses in Cape Town that is searchable online.    The idea is to create a repository, a "Rainbow Pages", where LGBTQIA+ businesses, organisations, communities, artists, professionals, side hustlers, etc. in Cape Town can list their work. Our vision is to create a platform where young people can seek out mentors in their fields, where professionals can connect and network, where people can seek out affirming healthcare practitioners, where allies can come to find local businesses to support and where you can see yourself in amongst other queers trying to make it happen for themselves.
